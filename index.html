    <p> In this life he is a idol and she is a oridinary normal student </p>
    <p> Under the gentle glow of the spotlight, she stood there—his idol, luminous and poised—while he, a humble student in the audience, felt his heart flutter with every note she sang. To everyone else she was perfection, distant and untouchable. But in his mind, she was so much more: a brave, passionate soul whose melodies both haunted and healed him. He watched her move through the song, feeling as though each breath she took was meant for him alone. In that sea of fans, his gaze remained fixed on her—feeling a craving not just for her music, but for the woman behind it. Every lyric she poured out seemed to speak the private truths he kept locked in his heart. And though he knew their worlds were miles apart, in that moment the distance dissolved—and all that remained was the quiet hope that one day, she might see him not just as a face in the crowd, but as the one who truly understood her.
