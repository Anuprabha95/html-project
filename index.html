    <h1>Love</h1>
    <h1>HER LOVE </h1>

    <p>Incomplete but Beautiful</p>
    <P>Thousands of flowers wants that one flower </P>
    <p> I first saw him in the corridor—one of those ordinary school mornings—but my world shifted. We exchanged glances like secret code, a spark igniting in my chest. We messaged for hours, shared laughs and dreams behind classroom doors. Yet, there were moments when he’d drift away, and I’d feel that old pang of fear: was I ever truly important to him? We never spoke of what that meant—our unspoken connection left hanging like a promise without a date. On the day of farewell, I waited by the door, heart pounding, but he never came. Instead, a simple note: “I’ll miss you. I love you.” And then… gone. No call. No reunion. Just the silence of what could have been. The story ends—not with closure, but with a breath held in a frame, forever waiting. </p>
    <h2>HIS CARE </h2>

    <p>without his care she is nothing </p>
    <p> He wasn’t a dreamer or a poet—but the way he cared spoke volumes. When I doubted myself, he’d gently remind me of my strengths. On nights when insomnia tugged at my mind, he’d text first thing in the morning: “Did you sleep at all?” He baked my favorite comfort snack after I’d had a rough day, and didn’t hesitate to hold me close even when I felt raw. In every little act—packing soup when I was sick, listening to my endless worries without judgment—he wove care into my world like sunlight through a window. His love wasn’t loud; it was the quiet strength I leaned on. Because of him, I learned that love isn't just a feeling—it’s showing up, again and again, even in the mundane. He inspired me to believe that caring deeply could heal wounds and lift souls—just as Lao Tzu said: “Caring for someone deeply gives you strength. Being cared for by someone deeply gives you courage.”

    <h3>THEIR LIFES BEGINS </h3>
    <img src="HE.jpg" alt="">
    <P> Their lifes begins with the different life style </P>
    <p> They met as the dawn light streamed through their shared apartment window—her, a freelance artist whose mornings began with coffee and sketching portraits softened by sunlight; him, a buttoned-up corporate engineer, always rushing out in a crisp shirt and tie to catch the 9-to-5 grind. Their rhythms clashed: she woke late, lingering over creativity; he woke early, precise to the minute. Weekends were a subtle battle of habits—her spontaneous desire to explore hidden cafés, his preference for structured routines and productivity. But when he paused mid‑morning to ask about the colors she’d chosen for a painting, and she stayed late one Friday to hear him describe a project’s elegant complex solution, a bridge formed.

They learned balance from each other—she found comfort in small rituals like his evening walks after sunset; he discovered the joy of unplanned afternoons in rain-soaked parks. Over time, their differing lifestyles didn’t divide them—they wove together: mornings of shared coffee where art met architecture, spontaneous evenings of impromptu museum trips after work, and lazy Sundays spent alternating between her sketchbooks and his engineering podcasts.

    <h3> IDOL LOVE </h3>

    <p> In this life he is a idol and she is a oridinary normal student </p>
    <p> Under the gentle glow of the spotlight, she stood there—his idol, luminous and poised—while he, a humble student in the audience, felt his heart flutter with every note she sang. To everyone else she was perfection, distant and untouchable. But in his mind, she was so much more: a brave, passionate soul whose melodies both haunted and healed him. He watched her move through the song, feeling as though each breath she took was meant for him alone. In that sea of fans, his gaze remained fixed on her—feeling a craving not just for her music, but for the woman behind it. Every lyric she poured out seemed to speak the private truths he kept locked in his heart. And though he knew their worlds were miles apart, in that moment the distance dissolved—and all that remained was the quiet hope that one day, she might see him not just as a face in the crowd, but as the one who truly understood her.
